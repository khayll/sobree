/**
 * Y.Doc shape used by Sobree.
 *
 * The document is stored as a Y.Doc — that's the source of truth.
 * `SobreeDocument` is a *projection* of this Y.Doc, computed by the
 * helpers in `./project.ts` and cached by the Editor.
 *
 * # Top-level layout
 *
 * ```
 * ydoc
 * ├── getArray("body")  : Y.Array<Y.Map>     — block list, one Y.Map per block
 * ├── getMap("meta")    : Y.Map              — sections, styles, numbering,
 * │                                            headerFooterBodies, fonts.
 * │                                            Stored as JSON-encoded values
 * │                                            (rarely edited concurrently).
 * │                                            Phase 1c may split fields into
 * │                                            per-key Y types.
 * ├── getMap("parts")    : Y.Map<Uint8Array>  — inline binary parts
 * │                                              (legacy / no-BlobStore path).
 * └── getMap("partRefs") : Y.Map<string>       — partPath → SHA-256 hex hash
 *                                              (Phase 3.2+ / BlobStore path).
 *                                              Bytes live in a side-channel
 *                                              `BlobStore`; the editor's
 *                                              `BlobCache` resolves hashes.
 * ```
 *
 * Both `parts` and `partRefs` coexist — projection unions them so a
 * Y.Doc with inline legacy bytes alongside hash-addressed refs reads
 * correctly. The editor writes to whichever path matches its config
 * (BlobStore → partRefs, otherwise parts).
 *
 * # Block Y.Map shape — paragraphs (Phase 1b.5+)
 *
 * Paragraph blocks (kind === `"paragraph"`, including headings) are
 * structured for char-level CRDT:
 *
 * ```
 * paragraphMap
 * ├── get("id")    : string         — stable block id (matches BlockRegistry)
 * ├── get("kind")  : "paragraph"    — discriminator
 * ├── get("text")  : Y.Text         — runs flatten into here, marks for marks,
 * │                                    embeds for breaks/tabs/fields/drawings,
 * │                                    `link: { href }` mark for hyperlink chars
 * └── get("props") : string (JSON)  — ParagraphProperties (alignment, indent,
 *                                     numbering, …). JSON-encoded for v0.1;
 *                                     concurrent property edits clobber.
 * ```
 *
 * # Block Y.Map shape — non-paragraphs
 *
 * Section breaks and tables stay JSON-encoded — neither has inline
 * text content with concurrent-edit demand. Tables get their own
 * structural CRDT in a future Phase 1c (per-cell Y.Map<body Y.Array>).
 *
 * ```
 * otherBlockMap
 * ├── get("id")    : string             — stable block id
 * └── get("_ast")  : string (JSON)      — JSON-encoded Block
 * ```
 *
 * # Y.Text mark conventions
 *
 * The mapping between Sobree's `RunProperties` and Y.Text marks is
 * 1:1 — `bold: true` becomes `{ bold: true }` on each char's
 * attributes. Two special cases:
 *
 *   - `link: { href }` — chars inside a `HyperlinkRun` carry this mark.
 *     The decoder reconstructs the HyperlinkRun by grouping consecutive
 *     same-href chars.
 *   - Embeds — non-text runs (break / tab / field / drawing) appear as
 *     embed objects (`{ insert: { __sobree: "<kind>", … } }` in delta
 *     form), occupying one position in the Y.Text.
 *
 * See `./runs.ts` for the conversion helpers and `./textDiff.ts` for
 * the smart Y.Text diff that preserves CRDT semantics across applies.
